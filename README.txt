INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
1. Creating your own custom CSS
  All your custom CSS should be added to "my-style.css"
    - TIP: use firebug (http://getfirebug.com/) for FireFox, or the Developer Tools in WebKit browsers (Safari, Chrome) to help with finding the appropriate IDs and Classes
 
2. Adding images
  All images you wish to add to your custom design should be placed under images/
  Example usage in my-style.css:
    #wrapper {
      background: url(images/bg-image.jpg) top center repeat #808080;
    }
 
3. Changing your favicon
  Replace the favicon.ico with a 16x16 Windows ICO file
    - TIP: use the Photoshop plugin (http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/)
 
4. Previewing your custom design
  Use the static HTML files to locally preview your design
 
5. Applying your design to the live site
  Once you are done with your design and have previewed the results with the included static HTML files:
    - zip the "style-kit" directory
    - upload the style-kit.zip file in the "Look and feel > Customize" section of builder
 
 
NOTE
--------------------------
1. DO NOT make any edits to the static HTML files or the files in the assets/ directory. These are only for previewing your custom design. Any changes to them will be removed.
